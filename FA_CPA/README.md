# WCD_Calculation
This is used for the LORIA research internship and worst-case delay (WCD) calculation. 

In this research, I studied transmission process of virtual links in network system and precisely calculate worst-case delay
                    simulated several network models of switches and links with Python and PyCPA tool 
                and completed a technical report that provides 5 sets of simulated data for team using approaches such as CPA and Network Calculus.

This folder simulated switched-based Ethernet Network model with 4 ending systems and more than 10 virtual links 
and computed the tightest worst-case delay of model for each VL using Compositional Performance Analysis approach with PyCPA tool.
